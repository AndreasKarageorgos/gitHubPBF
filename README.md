# GitHub PUSH BIG FOLDERS

```This script is designed to allow you to push folders larger than 2GB to GitHub. It pushes the files individually to GitHub, preventing GitHub from detecting that you're attempting to push a folder of 2GB or more.```

```This could potentially create spam, so it's important to inform your team members if you're working collaboratively.```

---

To run the script you will need ```python3```

Download python3 [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## HOW TO USE

First, copy the script into the same directory as the ```.git``` folder After that open your terminal to the same directory as the script and run it.

Run the script:

* Linux/MacOS

        python3 githubPBF.py

* Windows

        python githubPBF.py

    ```or just double click it.```
